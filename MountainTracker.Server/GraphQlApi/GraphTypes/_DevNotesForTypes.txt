Since could likely be repeated comments, think of this like a general comments page shared for use among types
-There was problems with the scoping and context. 
The issue was that the graph objects did not start a new scope for all the functions that were called but also started threads. 
This is an issue when the context for the db is called twice in a non thread safe mannor. The solution was to manage the scope some.
This meant that a scope will be opened prior to the function and passed into the function for use. 
I attempted a transt approch at first but it broke the dataloader and made the loader not effective for its work.
I did note that sometimes it was fine to allow it to be shared if the object was the same. 
It was good in these cases as it waited to combine anyway making it more effectice to use one per the grouping.
I did want to contain the function in an abstract class but I got access violations so it looks like it needs to remain inline for now.
